<h3><a id = "BkMrk_1">Summary</a></h3>
    <p><code>frmTemplate</code> has an <code>ExpTree</code> Control in its' Left Panel and a ListView in its' Right Panel. The <code>ExpTree</code>
       shows a heirarchical view of Folders present on the host system. The root of the ExpTree display may be set to one of 
       a number of Special Folders. The most commonly used of these are the Desktop or Computer (My Computer on some systems). Selecting
       a Node of this tree will cause the ListView to display the Content of the Selected Folder.</p>
    <p><code>frmTemplate</code> uses a single threaded method of populating the ListView. Working 
        with Local Folders with a reasonable number of Files/Folders on a newer PC, this 
        provides quite acceptable responsiveness. For applications designed to work with 
        Remote Folders or very large Local Folders, <a href="frmThread.htm">frmThread</a> will normally provide a 
        better user experience as discussed <a href="Responsiveness.htm">here</a>.</p>
<h3><a id = "BkMrk_2">Capabilities</a></h3>
    <p>Simply displaying the structure and Content of Folders is not enough for a useful application. The real question is what the
       application can do with the displayed items. <code>frmTemplate</code> (as well as <code>frmThread</code>) supports the following
       capabilites:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Displaying the Folder content in most standard Views - Details, Large Icons, Tile, List, and Small Icons.</li>
        <li>Dropping a File/Folder onto ExpTree and/or the ListView. This feature support the normal Windows Control-Key modifiers
            and Right Button Drag menu to instruct the receiving Control to Copy or Move the File(s)/Folders(s) to the Target
            Folder. The Drop Source may be itself or any window (including Windows Explorer) 
            that provides at least FileDrop (CF_HDROP) DataFormatted information.</li>
        <li>Dragging File(s)/Folder(s) from the ExpTree or the ListView. Normal Windows 
            Control-Key and Right Button Drag operations are supported. The Drop Target may 
            be itself or any window (including Windows Explorer) that accepts at least 
            FileDrop (CF_HDROP) DataFormatted information.</li>
        <li>Right-Click on a File/Folder to display the same ContextMenu that Windows 
            Explorer would display to perform the same operations. File/Folder Rename 
            support included.</li>
        <li>Edit of the First Column of the ListView -- if and only if the first Column is 
            the File/Folder name.</li>
        <li>Automatic Update of the ListView when any changes are made by any process to the 
            displayed Folder or its&#39; Content.</li>
        <li>Column-Click Sorting (with Sort Glyph) of the ListView Columns when displayed in 
            Details View.</li>
        <li>Selected Item(s) Delete in response to the Delete Key.</li>
        <li>Double-Click on a File to &quot;Open&quot; it.</li>
    </ul>
<h3><a id = "BkMrk_3">Modifying the ListView for an Application</a></h3>
    <p><code>frmTemplate</code> is a <i>base</i>, worked example of how to implement 
        these capabilites in a ListView. An application will probably have diferent or 
        additional requirements. The <b>Cardinal Rule</b> when modifying the ListView is that each
       <code>ListViewItem</code> <b>must</b> have the appropriate <code>CShItem</code> instance in its' <code>.Tag</code> Property.
       The underlying implication is that each <code>ListViewItem</code> represents a <i>single, unique File or Folder</i>,
       all within one single Folder (e.g. the Desktop or Computer or C:\Users\username\Documents\Fax). 
        Additionally, the <code>ListView</code> itself must have its&#39; .Tag Property set to the 
        CShItem representing the <i>single</i> Folder that contains all <code>ListViewItems</code> 
        and their associated CShItems.</p>
    <p>A <b>second rule</b> is that the File/Directory Name should be in the first 
        (column 0) column. This is not quite as inflexible, but Rename and, probably, 
        some other functions depend on it. Do not violate the rule without very serious 
        understanding of how the ListView is used by the Form.</p>
    <p>See <code>frmTemplate.MakeLVItem</code> for how to populate the ListView.</p>
