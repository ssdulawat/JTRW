<h2><a id = "BkMrk_1">Version 3.01 Release Notes</a></h2>
    <p>Version 3.01 includes several bug fixes to Version 3.0, an additional CShItem 
        Property signature, and an additional Project containing several test Forms that 
        may be of interest to a developer. The major takeaway from this Release is that 
        some early users of ExpTreeLib have put it to some extreme tests and have only 
        found a few problems in some fairly extreme cases.</p>
<h3><a id = "BkMrk_2">Bug Fixes</a></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Two fixes dealing with situations that may arise when multiple Forms, each using 
            ExpTreeLib, are running from the same application. This includes both MDI and 
            non-MDI cases. </li>
        <li>GIven a Folder that was included in an ExpTree Control <i>and</i> that Folder 
            had never been Expanded <i>and</i> an external application (eg Windows Explorer) 
            was used to add a sub-Folder to that Folder, then other sub-Folders of that 
            Folder would not be shown in the ExpTree when the Folder was Expanded. This is 
            now fixed.</li>
        <li>In a few cases, in the IDE, it was necessary to set the ExpTree.StartupDirectory Property to something other than the Desktop and then
            change back to the Desktop before an ExpTree Control would show the Desktop content in the IDE. This has been fixed.</li>
    </ul>
<h3><a id = "BkMrk_3">Variant of CShItem.GetFiles</a></h3>
    <p>
        Added CShItem.GetFiles(Filter as String) This was in response to a question from
        a user who had used a similar routine in Version 2.11. 
        This is a much improved version relative to the 2.11 version of this code.</p>
    <p>
        This method will only return those Files whose FileName matches the Filter. 
        Pattern matching with the Filter is done using the VB &quot;Like&quot; operator so 
        wildcards are accepted. For example a Filter of &quot;*w*.txt&quot; will only return Text 
        files whose FileName contains a &quot;w&quot;. Pattern matching is case-insensitive so 
        &quot;AnyWay.txt&quot; and &quot;wilson.txt&quot; will both match the pattern.</p>
    <p>
        Normally the application will not use this, but rather will apply its&#39; own 
        Filter to match its&#39; own requirements.</p>
<h3><a id = "BkMrk_4">Added Project</a></h3>
    <p>
                The Version 3.01 Source download now includes an additional Project - ExpTree_Test. That project contains several additional
       Forms that may be of interest to a developer.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>frmDisplay - A simple Form containing a TextBox which may be used for displaying 
            additional information during the development process. It is used by one of the 
            test routines in frmThread_TestVersion.</li>
        <li>frmThread_TestVersion - is basically frmThread with instrumentation and a number 
            of little test routines, all of which were of use at some point in the 
            developement of frmThread but were removed from the normal frmThread in 
            ExpTree_Demo.</li>
        <li>frmSearchBox - a limited variant of frmThread which displays a SearchBox for 
            excercising the GetFiles(Filter) added method. The limit in this Form is that 
            all Dynamic Updating has been disabled.</li>
        <li>frmTestMulti - A simple Form which will launch as many copies of frmThread as 
            desired - one for each time the one and only button on frmTestMulti is Clicked.</li>
    </ul>
