        In the discussion below, text blocks marked like <span class="note">this text</span>
        is additional information that is related to the main text, but may be skipped to
        follow the main line of the discussion. Text in <b>bold</b> contains the main points
        of the discussion.</p>
<h3><a id="TreeSearch_BkMk">Searching the Internal Tree</a></h3>
    <p>All CShItems, like all ShellItems in the Shell Namespace, are contained in a 
        Folder (except the Desktop). Each Folder CShItem contains two Collections, one 
        for Folders and one for Files. Thus the tree consists of the Desktop CShItem, 
        which contains a Collection of Folder, each of which also contains a Collection 
        of Folders, and so on. The entire internal tree then consists of the Desktop 
        CShItem. All CShItems will reside in the Desktop or in one of the Folders 
        contained within one of the Folders contained by the Desktop.</p>
    <p><b>Every CShItem has its&#39; own PIDL Property containing an Absolute PIDL which 
        fully describes its&#39; location in the Shell Namespace</b>. This Absolute PIDL 
        also fully describes its&#39; location in the internal tree. Therefore, it is 
        possible to determine if one PIDL (PIDL_A) is an <b>Ancestor</b> of another PIDL 
        (PIDL_C) - that is - does PIDL_C fall somewhere under PIDL_A in the tree. It is 
        also possible to determine if PIDL_A is the Parent of PIDL_C where <b>Parent</b> 
        means that PIDL_C is directly contained within PIDL_A. It is also possible to 
        determine if PIDL_C is <b>Equal</b> to PIDL_A.</p>
    <p>Given the nature of the internal tree, the following code is used to locate 
        a PIDL in the tree, returning Nothing if the PIDL does not exist in the 
        tree:</p>
<pre lang="vbnet">
    Public Shared Function FindCShItem(ByVal BaseItem As CShItem, ByVal Abs As IntPtr) As CShItem
        FindCShItem = Nothing
        If IsEqual(BaseItem.PIDL, Abs) Then Return BaseItem
        If BaseItem.FilesInitialized AndAlso IsAncestorOf(BaseItem.PIDL, Abs, True) Then
            For Each FItem As CShItem In BaseItem.FileList
                If IsEqual(FItem.PIDL, Abs) Then Return FItem
            Next
        End If
        If BaseItem.FoldersInitialized Then
            For Each DItem As CShItem In BaseItem.DirectoryList
                If IsEqual(DItem.PIDL, Abs) Then Return DItem
                If IsAncestorOf(DItem.PIDL, Abs) Then
                    Return FindCShItem(DItem, Abs)
                End If
            Next
        End If
    End Function
</pre>        
    <p>A few notes may be needed about the Code:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>This code is the base CShItem.FindCShItem used for all searches that do not expand the internal tree.</li>
        <li>The Function is initially called with the Desktop as the BaseItem. The function
            calls itself recursively to walk down the internal tree, only looking at Folders
            that are known to be Ancestors of the desired item.</li>
        <li>The Properties BaseItem.xxxInitialized return False if the application has 
            never, directly or indirectly, expressed an interest in that Collection of Files 
            and Folders. Remember we are not looking for the actual Files/Folders, just 
            their CShItems as they exist in the tree.</li>
        <li>The IsAncestor call in line 4 prevents querying BaseItem.FileList unless the 
            BaseItem is the immediate (Parent) ancestor of Abs.</li>
        <li>The functions 
            <see cref = "M:ExpTreeLib.CShItem.IsAncestorOf">
            IsAncestorOf</see> and
            <see cref = "M:ExpTreeLib.CShItem.IsEqual">
            IsEqual</see> base their results on the Absolute PIDLs 
            that are given to them. These functions are the key to searching the tree and 
            are discussed on the <a href="TechNote4.htm">next page</a>.</li>
