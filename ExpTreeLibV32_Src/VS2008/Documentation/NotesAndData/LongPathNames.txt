The bcl team was a Framework team and Kim Hamilton was a member. Discussion of long file names in .Net.

The below is from part 1 of a 3 part blog series, all of which is quite interesting.

I ran into this problem about a year ago, and I found I couldn't get around it, even when passing in the shortened path (using filena~1 style filenames).  Even after I had p-invoked GetShortFileName() and shortened every part of the path, the exception thrown from the framework mentioned the full, expanded path.
 
I had absolutely no desire to rewrite System.IO, so I ended up changing my directory structure.  To a user of the framework, it just seems like a lot of work that I shouldn't have to go through.

Steve, 

I'm glad you mentioned this. A few users have attempted this appealing workaround, but we foil it because we expand short paths as part of file name normalization, throwing once it exceeds MAX_PATH.
 
We definitely agree that users shouldn't have to handle the workarounds we're forcing -- i.e. rewriting System.IO or changing the dir structure.
 
Thanks,
 
Kim
